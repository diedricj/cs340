               <th>Porcelain</th>
               <td>Porcelain originated from China, and is a combination of clay and flint, meant to have small particles and a very small particle size</td>
               <td>Porcelain is used to create very strong pieces that can be either painted or glazed</td>
               <td>Porcelain is very popular for its white color in appearance that can be achieved with no glaze</td>
               <td>Porcelain is also very popular for its transparency.  This can be achieved when porcelain is thrown with very thin walls, and lets light shine through the small particle size.</td>

               <th>Rocky Road</th>
               <td>Rocky Road is a general name for mixed clay.  It can come from a variety of places.  It usually has a larger particle size and is very industrial.</td>
               <td>Rocky Road is relatively cheap and can be used for learning.  It is a utility clay, while it is not excellent in any category, it can be used for almost anything.</td>
               <td>Rocky Road is typically a light gray color, and is usually applied a glazing to add color after firing.</td>
               <td>Rocky Road is not transparent.</td>

               <th>White Salmon</th>
               <td>White Salmon is a mix of normal clay that is white in color.  It has thin clay particles, and is meant to be a cheaper utility clay that resembles Porcelain.</td>
               <td>White Salmon is easier to throw with than porcelain clay, because it tends to absorb less water and maintain structure, but can still resemble porcelain in many ways.</td>
               <td>White Salmon has a white-ish pink color, that mimics that of Porcelain's whiteness.</td>
               <td>White Salmon and very thin spots in the clay can be transparent, but usually this is not achievable.</td>
